 "# Learning-Igor" 
This  Repository contains different codes that I've been developing since I came to the Solar Energy Institute (IES-UPM). 
LuisCelulas -> this code was the first one, and thanks to that, it is my favourite. I think is the most complex code, but it was not the hardest to implement
MagicBox -> this code was pretended to know how to control the Serial Port with Igor just coding. It was really exciting
Multi2000Faster -> this has been the hardest until now. This code was built from nowhere and I feel proud of my work. Now this Multimeter is working in the Lab thanks to my code, taking voltage measures next to the PreAmplifier, helping the developing of a more confortable Lab.
